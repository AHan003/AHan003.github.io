### CPSC 120

* [Lab 2](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-02-AHan003.git)
I enjoyed Lab 2 Part 1 as it was the start of everything that I would have to utilize in the lab later on. In Part 1, we had to style, format, and compile a function that converted Fahrenheit to Celsius. It was a fun way to learn and adapt to the processes that we would use later on in the course.

* [Lab 6](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-06-aaron-h-brian-m.git)
In Lab 6 Part 1, learning how to create a pattern with loops was amazing. In this lab, we used various for-loops to create a very intricate pattern. I felt great satisfaction after finishing this lab as once it was completed, we were able to complete and see the pattern that we made.

* [Lab 12](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-12-alton.git)
Lab 12, part 1 was another amazing lab as this lab implemented our coding skills in order to make a GIF file. In this part, there were lots of intricate formulas in which we had to use various mathematical formulas. Once we were able to complete that formula we then finally we where able to combine the various RGB values in order to get the animation. I would say for this lab it was very interesting and satisfying to see the output of the code just like in Lab 6, part 1.
